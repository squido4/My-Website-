    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    
  <p> It's not really a hobby but I really enjoyed backpacking.
      <br> I do enjoy going to the gym, although the gym rats are really big
      <br> and it's kind of wierd to 'mire them because they're too loud.
      <br> I also enjoy watching youtube videos because I often get lost
      <br> and end up watching something random, often involving bears.
